# JS-Exercise-Closures-Callbacks-ArrayMethods

This challenge focuses on closures, callbacks and array methods.

Use the combined power of the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and Google! For example, in order to learn about the reduce array method, nice Google search terms might be _mdn array reduce_ or _reduce site:mozilla.org_. If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at the job - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what things you have attempted already while trying to solve it.
